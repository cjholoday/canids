# CAN Intrusion Detection System Prototype #

This repository contains a prototype of an intrusion detection system my team developed for our senior engineering project. We use machine learning to detect attacks on a CAN bus, simulating a real-world scenario in automoobiles. We also prototype an attack simulator that sends packets on the CAN bus as an attacker might.
